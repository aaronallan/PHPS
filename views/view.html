  <p>For 150 years, Palapala Ho’omau Church has provided a sanctuary where residents and visitors may be in solitary peace or gather in grace.</p>

  <p>The Palapala Ho’omau Preservation Society seeks to restore the church building for future generations in a manner respectful of the original architecture of the church.</p>

  <p>To continue its role in the life of the Kipahulu community and beyond as a place of worship, burials, celebrations, music, and meetings, Palapala Ho’omau requires restoration. A new roof and bell tower are urgently needed to keep the church open to visitors. Donations are also accepted to build the endowment to maintain the grounds and graves.</p>

  <p>Established in 2012, the <strong>Palapala Ho'omau Preservation Society</strong>, is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization based in the State of Hawaii.</p>

  <p>Mahalo for your kokua</p>
